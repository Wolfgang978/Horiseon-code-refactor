# Horiseon-code-refactor
Refactoring of starter code given to me. The main purpose of the refactoring will be to add semantic elements in place of divs and make sure the web page still looks as designed.
There were a few other issues that needed to be refactored. Here is the screenshots showing my refactored code website still looks like the original.
